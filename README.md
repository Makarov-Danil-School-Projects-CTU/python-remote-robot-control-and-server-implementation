üìù Task Objective<br>
Create a web server for the automatic control of remote robots. The robots will autonomously register with the server, which will then guide them towards the center of a coordinate system. For testing purposes, each robot starts at random coordinates and attempts to reach the coordinate [0,0]. Upon reaching the target coordinate, the robot must retrieve a secret. On the way to the goal, robots may encounter obstacles that they must navigate around. The server is capable of guiding multiple robots simultaneously and implements a flawless communication protocol.

The objective for each robot is to reach the [0,0] coordinate.

Secret Retrieval:<br>
Once at [0,0], the robot must retrieve a secret.

Obstacle Avoidance:<br>
Robots may encounter obstacles that they need to navigate around while moving towards the target.

Multi-Robot Navigation:<br>
The server must be capable of navigating multiple robots simultaneously.

Communication Protocol:<br>
The server must implement and handle the communication protocol flawlessly, ensuring that all navigation commands and status updates are correctly transmitted between the server and the robots.
